**Chakram**                      | OK             | BITMASK
**Keris Wireless**               | OK             | BITMASK

Devices with **BROKEN** HID descriptors needs some fixes using kernel module, so patches are welcome.

You canâ€™t change the mouse settings without descriptor fixes but keyboard events should work.

Devices with keyboard events packed as **BITMASK** may not needed this driver
and should work with vanilla kernel. **BITMASK** driver mode was made
as reference implementation for testing and debugging purposes.

All devices connected via bluetooth should also work without this driver.
